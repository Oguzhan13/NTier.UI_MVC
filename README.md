# NTier.UI_MVC

N-Tier MVC Project
This is a sample N-Tier MVC (Model-View-Controller) project built with the .NET Framework. The project follows a layered architecture to separate concerns and improve maintainability, scalability, and reusability. It includes the following layers:

Presentation Layer (UI_MVC_GenericRepositoryAndBusiness)

This layer contains the ASP.NET MVC web application, responsible for handling user interface interactions.
NuGet Packages used in this layer:
Microsoft.EntityFramework.Core.Design: For using migrations and working with the database.
Microsoft.EntityFramework.Core.SqlServer: For using SQL Server as the database.
Business Layer (Business)

This layer contains the business logic and rules of the application.
It is responsible for processing data, applying business rules, and orchestrating data flow between the presentation layer and the data access layer.
NuGet Packages used in this layer:
No additional packages mentioned in the provided description.
Data Access Layer (Access)

This layer is responsible for interacting with the database and performing CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations.
It provides an abstraction over the database, allowing the business layer to work with entities without worrying about the underlying database technology.
NuGet Packages used in this layer:
Microsoft.EntityFramework.Core: For using Entity Framework Core and working with the database.
Microsoft.EntityFramework.Core.SqlServer: For using SQL Server as the database.
Microsoft.EntityFramework.Core.Tools: For using migrations and database operations.
Core Layer (Core)

This layer contains shared components, interfaces, and entities used throughout the application.
It defines the core entities, such as Person and Tweet, that are used in the business and data access layers.
No additional packages mentioned in the provided description.
Project Setup
Create the Core, Access, Business, and UI_MVC_GenericRepositoryAndBusiness projects in the solution.

Configure the DbContext in the Access layer by creating a class named AppDbContext and specifying the database connection string in appsettings.Development.json.

Create entity classes Person and Tweet in the Core layer, representing the main entities used in the application.

Implement the data access layer in the Access project by creating repositories for Person and Tweet entities. Use Entity Framework Core to interact with the database.

Implement the business logic layer in the Business project by creating services for Person and Tweet entities. These services will contain the business logic for processing data and applying business rules.

Configure dependency injection in the UI_MVC_GenericRepositoryAndBusiness project to inject the services from the Business layer into the controllers in the Presentation layer.

Create the necessary views and controllers in the UI_MVC_GenericRepositoryAndBusiness project to handle user interactions and display data.

NuGet Packages
The project uses the following NuGet packages:

Microsoft.EntityFramework.Core.Design: For working with migrations and database operations.
Microsoft.EntityFramework.Core.SqlServer: For using SQL Server as the database in the Access and Data layers.
Microsoft.EntityFramework.Core.Tools: For executing migrations and database operations.
Microsoft.EntityFramework.Core: For using Entity Framework Core in the Access layer.

Running the Project
Make sure you have the necessary NuGet packages installed.

Set up the database connection string in appsettings.Development.json to point to your SQL Server instance.

Run the migrations using the Package Manager Console and update the database.

Build and run the UI_MVC_GenericRepositoryAndBusiness project to launch the application.

Enjoy your N-Tier MVC project with Entity Framework Core!
